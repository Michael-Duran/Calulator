Description:	This is a simple calculator application that performs basic 
				calculator functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide). It 
				calculates with an accuracy of 8 digits past the decimal place. 

Status:			This application runs with no known errors, but has not 
				been extensively tested for bugs. 

Technical:		The View Controller determines if a number (operand) or function
				(operator) is pressed and determines which action to take. 
				- If a only numbers are pressed, only the view is updated and no
					calls to a class are made.
				- Once an operator is pressed, it sends the current number on 
					the display and the operator to a class that calculates 
					the running total (if there are previous inputs) or just 
					updates the display.
				- The display is then  updated, either way, to reflect the 
					current values.
